- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @solisruben296
- let us instantly drop this template!
- i made this acc so i can learn how to code, what to code, where to code, everything about nerd code stuff. why? i dont know, probably mindustry or fnf or something. also so i can make my own games, maybe. dont count on it.
- if you're willing to teach me, that would be very appreciated
- if you wish to contact me, contact me through discord by "Basic Turret#6813" (without the "). i dont use any other social media because none of them fit me.
